Light Weight WiFi Management Tool Set for Conferences inspired by Dragorn's ShmooCon System

# Hopes and Dreams
This is a project I'm throwing to together to provide a lightweight toolset
for wireless admins at conferences. The hope is to be able to provide the
following:

 * Self Registration for Conference Guests
 * Integrated RADIUS Server
 * MAC Address Blocking
 * User Management
 * Basic VLAN Assignment for Classes of Users
 * System packaged in Docker Containers or ablity to run it on bare metal
